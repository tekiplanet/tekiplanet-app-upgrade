# Learning Rewards Conversion System

## Overview
Enable users to convert their learning rewards into various benefits, with the conversion process tied to completing specific tasks. Admins can define tasks, associate them with reward point ranges, and specify the reward for each task. The system must track task completion and ensure rewards are granted only after successful completion.

## Conversion Options
- Convert to cash (added to wallet balance)
- Convert to coupon code for store products
- Convert to free access to a paid course
- Convert to a discount code for services

## Task Types (for conversion eligibility)
- Refer people to register on the platform (track referrals)
- Complete a specified course (track course completion)
- Share a product link (track sharing)
- Refer someone to purchase a course (track referral purchases)

## Admin Features
- Add/edit/delete tasks
- Assign tasks to learning reward point ranges
- Specify the reward for each task (cash, coupon, course access, discount code)
- When creating a task, the admin can:
  - Select the task type (e.g., referral, course completion, sharing, etc.)
  - Select the reward type (e.g., cash, coupon, course access, discount code)
  - Based on the reward type, select from existing products, coupons, or courses, or enter a cash amount/discount details
  - For example:
    - If the reward is a coupon, select from available coupons
    - If the reward is course access, select from available paid courses
    - If the reward is cash, enter the amount
    - If the reward is a discount code, enter the percentage and specify the service
  - For some task types (e.g., refer to buy product), select the specific product

## Admin Conversion Rewards Menu (How It Works)

A new "Conversion Rewards" group is available in the admin sidebar. It contains:

- **Task Types**: Define the types of tasks users can be assigned to convert their rewards (e.g., referral, course completion, sharing, etc.). Admins can add, edit, or delete task types. These are used to categorize tasks.
- **Reward Types**: Define the types of rewards users can receive (e.g., cash, coupon, course access, discount). Admins can add, edit, or delete reward types. These are used to specify what a user gets after completing a task.
- **Tasks**: The main configuration. Admins create tasks, assign them a task type, a reward type, and specify the minimum and maximum reward points required to be eligible for the task. Each task represents a possible conversion action a user can be assigned. Admins can add, edit, or delete tasks. When creating or editing a task, the form will dynamically show the correct selection fields (dropdowns) for products, coupons, or courses based on the chosen task and reward type.

**How they work together:**
- Admins first define the available task types and reward types.
- Then, admins create tasks, selecting from the available types and rewards, and set the points range for eligibility. The form will show the correct fields for each reward type (e.g., coupon dropdown, course dropdown, cash amount, discount details).
- When a user wants to convert their learning rewards, the system will select a random eligible task (based on their points) from the tasks defined here.
- After the user completes the task, the system will grant the specified reward.

## User Flow
1. User chooses to convert learning rewards
2. System selects a random eligible task based on user's reward points
3. User completes the task
4. System verifies completion and grants the specified reward
5. User claims the reward (course access or cash)
6. System marks the reward as claimed and prevents duplicate claims

## Share Link Tracking System (Enhanced)

### Overview
The share link tracking system has been significantly enhanced with comprehensive analytics, expiration management, and robust tracking capabilities.

### Key Features

#### **7-Day Expiration**
- All share links automatically expire after 7 days from creation
- Expired links are marked as inactive and no longer track purchases
- Users must create new share links after expiration

#### **Self-Referral Prevention**
- Users cannot gain rewards by purchasing through their own share links
- System automatically detects and prevents self-referral attempts
- Self-referral attempts are logged but don't affect the share link's status

#### **Enhanced Analytics**
- **Click Tracking**: Records every visit to share links with IP, user agent, and referrer
- **Conversion Rate**: Calculates percentage of clicks that result in purchases
- **Detailed Visit History**: Tracks individual visits with timestamps and visitor information
- **Purchase Analytics**: Comprehensive tracking of all purchases through share links

#### **Multiple Share Link Support**
- Users can have multiple active share links for different products
- Frontend stores share link IDs per product to prevent conflicts
- Backend processes multiple share links in a single order

#### **Robust Error Handling**
- Share tracking failures don't disrupt order processing
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Graceful handling of invalid or expired share links

### Database Schema Enhancements

#### **user_product_shares Table (Enhanced)**
```sql
-- New columns added
expires_at timestamp NULL -- 7-day expiration
click_count integer DEFAULT 0 -- Total clicks
visitor_session_id varchar(255) NULL -- Session tracking
```

#### **share_link_visits Table (New)**
```sql
CREATE TABLE share_link_visits (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    user_product_share_id uuid REFERENCES user_product_shares(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    visitor_ip varchar(45) NULL,
    user_agent varchar(500) NULL,
    referrer varchar(500) NULL,
    visited_at timestamp NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp NOT NULL,
    updated_at timestamp NOT NULL
);
```

### API Endpoints

#### **Share Link Analytics**
- `POST /api/share-links/track-visit` - **Public endpoint** to track a share link click (no auth required)
- `GET /api/share-links/analytics/{shareId}` - Get analytics for specific share link
- `GET /api/share-links/overall-analytics` - Get overall share link statistics

**Note**: The track-visit endpoint is public to allow anonymous visitor tracking, while analytics endpoints require authentication.

### Frontend Integration

#### **Product Details Page**
- Detects share link parameters from URL (`?share=`) in both standard query strings and hash fragments
- **Automatically calls tracking API** on page load to record the visit and increment click count
- Stores share link ID in localStorage with product-specific keys for checkout tracking
- Preserves tracking information during the purchase flow
- **Non-blocking tracking**: Visit logging is fire-and-forget with silent error handling

#### **Checkout Process**
- Retrieves multiple share link IDs from localStorage
- Sends all relevant share link IDs to backend with order
- Cleans up localStorage after successful order completion

#### **Tasks Page**
- Displays product details and share links for "Share Product" tasks
- Shows copy-to-clipboard functionality for share links
- Displays progress tracking (purchases vs target)
- Shows conversion rates and analytics

### Backend Services

#### **ProductShareService**
- `generateShareLink()` - Creates share links with 7-day expiration using share's UUID
- `trackShareClick()` - Records visits with detailed analytics and flexible identifier resolution
- `recordVisit()` - Logs individual visits with visitor information (IP, user-agent, referrer)
- **Enhanced identifier support**: Accepts share_link (URL), share_id (UUID), or legacy user_conversion_task_id

#### **ShareLinkController**
- Handles share link visit tracking with flexible identifier support
- Provides analytics endpoints for authenticated users
- Manages overall share link statistics
- **Public track-visit endpoint**: Allows anonymous visitor tracking without authentication

### Security Features

#### **Self-Referral Prevention**
```php
// Prevents users from gaining rewards from their own share links
if ($shareLink->user_id === auth()->id()) {
    \Log::info('Self-referral prevented', [
        'share_link_id' => $shareLinkId,
        'user_id' => auth()->id(),
        'order_id' => $order->id
    ]);
    continue; // Skip this share link
}
```

#### **Expiration Management**
```php
public function hasExpired(): bool
{
    return $this->expires_at && $this->expires_at->isPast();
}

public function isActive(): bool
{
    return $this->status === 'active' && !$this->hasExpired();
}
```

### Analytics and Reporting

#### **Conversion Rate Calculation**
```php
public function getConversionRate(): float
{
    if ($this->click_count === 0) {
        return 0.0;
    }
    return round(($this->purchase_count / $this->click_count) * 100, 2);
}
```

#### **Visit Tracking**
```php
public function recordVisit(string $visitorIp = null, string $userAgent = null, string $referrer = null): void
{
    $this->increment('click_count');
    $this->visits()->create([
        'visitor_ip' => $visitorIp,
        'user_agent' => $userAgent,
        'referrer' => $referrer,
        'visited_at' => now(),
    ]);
}
```

- ✅ Created `ShareLinkController` with endpoints for visit tracking and analytics
- ✅ Added conversion rate calculation and detailed visit tracking
- ✅ Implemented overall analytics for admin monitoring
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

### ✅ **COMPLETED - Share Link Tracking Fixes and Improvements**

#### **Issues Identified and Resolved**
1. **Missing Visit Tracking**: ProductDetails page wasn't calling the tracking API on page load
2. **Protected Endpoint**: POST `/api/share-links/track-visit` was behind auth, blocking anonymous visitors
3. **Share ID Mismatch**: Earlier links used user_conversion_task_id in `?share=`, but tracking only looked up by full URL
4. **Hash Router Parsing**: Frontend couldn't extract share parameters from hash-based URLs

#### **Backend Fixes Applied**
- **Public Tracking Endpoint**: Moved `POST /api/share-links/track-visit` outside auth middleware to allow anonymous visitor tracking
- **Flexible Identifier Support**: Enhanced `trackVisit()` to accept:
  - `share_link` (full URL)
  - `share_id` (share UUID)
  - Legacy fallback to `user_conversion_task_id`
- **Improved Share Link Generation**: Standardized to use share's UUID in generated links while maintaining backward compatibility
- **Enhanced ProductShareService**: Updated `trackShareClick()` with robust identifier resolution logic

#### **Frontend Fixes Applied**
- **Automatic Visit Tracking**: ProductDetails now calls `storeService.trackShareVisit()` on page load when `?share=` is detected
- **Hash Router Support**: Added robust parsing to extract share parameters from both standard query strings and hash fragments
- **Fire-and-Forget Tracking**: Visit tracking is non-blocking and silent-fail to avoid impacting user experience
- **New API Method**: Added `trackShareVisit()` to storeService for public endpoint access

#### **Testing Results**
- ✅ **Click Tracking**: Visits now create `share_link_visits` records and increment `click_count`
- ✅ **Anonymous Visitors**: Public endpoint allows tracking of non-authenticated users
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy share links using user_conversion_task_id still work
- ✅ **Hash Router**: Share parameters properly extracted from `/#/dashboard/store/product/ID?share=SHARE_ID` format
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Tracking failures don't disrupt product page functionality

### 🎯 **Current Status: Fully Functional Share Link Tracking**

The enhanced share link tracking system is now complete and fully operational:

1. **Visit Tracking**: ✅ Working - clicks create visit records and increment counters
2. **Purchase Tracking**: ✅ Working - orders with share links record purchases and complete tasks
3. **Self-Referral Prevention**: ✅ Working - users can't gain rewards from their own links
4. **7-Day Expiration**: ✅ Working - expired links don't track clicks or purchases
5. **Analytics**: ✅ Working - conversion rates, visit history, and comprehensive reporting
6. **Multiple Products**: ✅ Working - multiple share links handled in single orders
7. **Frontend Integration**: ✅ Working - automatic tracking on page load with hash router support

**The share link tracking system is now production-ready and fully tested!**
