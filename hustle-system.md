## 📋 Complete Workflow

### 1. Admin Creates Hustle
**Backend**: `App\Http\Controllers\Admin\HustleController@store`
- Validates required fields: title, description, category_id, budget, deadline
- Creates hustle with status `'open'`
- **Automatic Notifications**:
  - Finds all professionals in the hustle's category
  - Sends in-app notifications via `NotificationService`
  - Queues email notifications via `HustleCreated` mail class
  - Notification includes hustle details and direct link

**Frontend**: Admin panel with hustle creation form

### 2. Professional Discovery & Application
**Frontend Components**:
- `Hustles.tsx` - Browse and search available hustles
- `HustleDetails.tsx` - View detailed hustle information
- `ApplyHustleDialog.tsx` - Application submission interface

**Process**:
- Professionals browse hustles filtered by category and search terms
- System checks `Professional->canApplyForHustle()` eligibility
- Must have complete professional profile to apply
- Creates `HustleApplication` with status `'pending'`

**Backend**: `App\Http\Controllers\HustleApplicationController@store`

### 3. Application Management & Approval
**Backend**: `App\Http\Controllers\Admin\HustleApplicationController`

**Approval Process**:
1. Admin reviews all applications for a hustle
2. When one application is approved:
   - Hustle status changes to `'approved'`
   - `assigned_professional_id` set to chosen professional
   - Approved applicant receives notification + email (`ApplicationApproved`)
   - **All other applications automatically rejected**
   - Rejected applicants receive notifications + emails (`ApplicationRejected`)

**Frontend**: Admin application management interface

### 4. Real-time Communication System
**Components**:
- `HustleChat.tsx` - Real-time chat interface
- `useHustleChat.ts` - WebSocket hook for live updates

**Features**:
- **Message Flow**:

- **Unread Tracking**: Message read status with notification badges
- **Auto-polling**: Fallback polling every 5 seconds
- **Message History**: Persistent chat history with timestamps

**Backend**: `App\Http\Controllers\HustleMessageController`

### 5. Project Execution & Status Management
**Status Progression**:
```
open → approved → in_progress → completed/cancelled
```

**Management**:
- Admin can update hustle status throughout lifecycle
