# Email Queue Setup Guide

## Problem Solved
The registration process was failing when SMTP errors occurred, even though the user account was created successfully. This has been fixed by implementing email queuing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Email Queue Jobs
- `SendVerificationEmail.php` - Handles initial verification emails
- `SendResendVerificationEmail.php` - Handles resend verification emails

### 2. Updated EmailVerificationService
- Changed from synchronous email sending to queued jobs
- Both initial and resend verification emails now use the queue

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Queue Driver
In your `.env` file, set:
```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

### 2. Create Jobs Table (if not exists)
Run the migration:
```bash
php artisan queue:table
php artisan migrate
```

### 3. Start Queue Worker
Run this command to process queued jobs:
```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

For production, you should use a process manager like Supervisor to keep the queue worker running.

### 4. Monitor Failed Jobs
To see failed jobs:
```bash
php artisan queue:failed
```

To retry failed jobs:
```bash
php artisan queue:retry all
```

## Benefits
1. **User accounts are created successfully** even if email fails
2. **Emails are retried automatically** (3 attempts with 30-second timeout)
3. **Failed emails are logged** for debugging
4. **Registration process is faster** since email sending is asynchronous
5. **Better user experience** - no more SMTP errors during registration

## Testing
1. Register a new user
2. Check that the user account is created immediately
3. Check the jobs table to see the queued email
4. Verify the email is sent when the queue worker processes it
